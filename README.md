# SQL-Project--Album-Collection
We are thrilled to share our work with you, showcasing our project for the "Database in Practice" module. This project involved working on an SQL project utilizing the "album_collection_schema" relational database schema provided by our module leader. We applied advanced SQL concepts throughout the project, covering topics such as creating customized views to display data, implementing triggers to automate database actions, and designing stored procedures and functions to facilitate interaction with databases. Our work was conducted using MySQL Workbench, and we hope you find the code snippets and outputs informative and engaging.
